Will the system be a good target for anyone?
Who would be managing the system? Updates? Extensions?
How technical are the users?
How big is the data?
What access should users have?
Is the information meant to be available 24/7?
Does it matter where the user accesses the web page? (home vs. work (vpn))
What would be the unique ID ?
Are we going to handle pictures?
What colors and fonts do you like?
